  Scenario: Scenario with step data table
    Given I want to calculate two numbers

      | number_a | number_b | expected |
      | 6        | 5        | 30        |
      | 5        | 4        | 20       |
    When Use multiplication method
    Then Result should be correct

  Scenario Outline: Scenario with examples
    Given I want to calculate <number_a> and <number_b>
    When Use addition operation
    Then Result is <expected>

    Examples: numbers data
      | number_a | number_b | expected |
      | 12        | 13        | 25        |
